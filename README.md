# ZTE-H3600-V9-PPPoE
i bought a new modem for my internet but it needed the pppoe to work so i asked the customer service but they refused to give me the pppoe password they said it was against their policy to change the modem(they charge so much for an shitty modem) so i made a script that tells you the pppoe username and password
